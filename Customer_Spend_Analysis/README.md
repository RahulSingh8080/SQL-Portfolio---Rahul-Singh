# üìä Customer Spend Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project

## üìù Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer spending behavior using SQL Server. It involves querying transactional data (`fact_spends`) and customer demographics (`dim_customers`) to extract insights such as high spenders, category-wise spends, income patterns, and more.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze total and category-wise customer spends.
- Identify spending behavior by age group, city, and occupation.
- Understand income trends by occupation.
- Filter spend data based on time (months) and product categories.

## üìå SQL Queries

### 1. Total spends per customer
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(spend) AS total_spend
FROM fact_spends
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 2. Total spends per customer using Debit Card
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(spend) AS total_spent
FROM fact_spends
WHERE card_type = 'Debit Card'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 3. Highest spend in 'Food' category in October
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 customer_id, spend
FROM fact_spends f
JOIN dim_customers d ON f.customer_id = d.customer_id
WHERE category = 'Food' AND month = 'October'
ORDER BY spend DESC;
```

### 4. Average income by occupation
```sql
SELECT occupation, AVG(income) AS avg_income
FROM dim_customers
GROUP BY occupation;
```

### 5. Customers who spent on 'Electronics'
```sql
SELECT d.customer_name, d.age_group
FROM fact_spends f
JOIN dim_customers d ON f.customer_id = d.customer_id
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

### 6. Total spend by city
```sql
SELECT d.city, SUM(f.spend) AS total_spend
FROM fact_spends f
JOIN dim_customers d ON f.customer_id = d.customer_id
GROUP BY d.city;
```

### 7. Average income of customers who spent on 'Entertainment' in July
```sql
SELECT AVG(d.income) AS avg_income
FROM fact_spends f
JOIN dim_customers d ON f.customer_id = d.customer_id
WHERE category = 'Entertainment' AND month = 'July';
```

### 8. Total spend per customer by age group and category
```sql
SELECT d.customer_id, d.age_group, f.category, SUM(f.spend) AS total_spend
FROM fact_spends f
JOIN dim_customers d ON f.customer_id = d.customer_id
GROUP BY d.customer_id, d.age_group, f.category;
```

## üíæ How to Run the Project

1. Import the CSV files into SQL Server using:
   - **SSMS** ‚Üí `Tasks` ‚Üí `Import Flat File`
   - Or use a `BULK INSERT` query.

2. Ensure the tables `fact_spends` and `dim_customers` are created.

3. Run the provided SQL queries in SSMS or your preferred SQL editor.

4. Export results as CSV (optional) by right-clicking result grid ‚Üí **Save Results As** ‚Üí CSV.

---

## üìà Optional Enhancements

- Visualize results in **Power BI** or **Tableau**.
- Automate data load and export using **Python (pandas + pyodbc)**.
- Create stored procedures or views for reusable insights.

---

## üß† Skills Used

- SQL Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
- Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT JOIN`)
- Filtering with `WHERE` and `GROUP BY`
- Data cleaning & transformation (optional preprocessing in Excel/Python)
